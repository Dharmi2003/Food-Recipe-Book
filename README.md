# Food Recipe Book

## Description
The **Food Recipe Book** is a React-based web application that allows users to search for food recipes and view detailed information, including images and instructions. The app fetches data from an API (TheMealDB API) based on the user's search input and displays a list of food items with corresponding images. Users can click on a recipe to view its detailed instructions and the image.

## Features
- Search for food recipes by name.
- View food items with images.
- Click on a recipe to view detailed instructions and the recipe image.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- React (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
- CSS (for styling)
- API: [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) for fetching recipe data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (for running the development server and installing dependencies)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (for managing JavaScript packages)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`
